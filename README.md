# Predicting Startup Profits with Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting the profits of startups using linear regression. The dataset contains information about 50 startups, including their R&D spend, administration costs, marketing spend, state location, and profits.

## Project Highlights:

- Utilize linear regression to predict startup profits based on key factors.
- Explore the dataset to gain insights into the relationship between startup features and profitability.
- Visualize the distribution of startups across states using a histogram.
- Analyze the relationships between features and profit using regression plots.
- Apply one-hot encoding to handle categorical data, such as state location.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Train a linear regression model to make profit predictions on unseen data.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R2 score.
- Gain valuable insights for entrepreneurs, investors, and decision-makers in the startup ecosystem.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries and dependencies.
3. Run the project script to perform data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Results:

The project provides accurate profit predictions for startups based on their R&D spend, administration costs, marketing spend, and state location. The evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the linear regression model in estimating profitability. The insights gained from this project can be valuable for entrepreneurs, investors, and decision-makers in the startup ecosystem.
